Addon for 2.4.3 WoW (The Burning Crusade) that posts Chuck Norris Facts.

With no modifier it will always send a fact to your current General Chat.

1) Download .ZIP and extract into wow/interface/addons folder. Rename folder from "ChuckNorris-master" to "ChuckNorris".
2) Slash commands are /cn, /chuck, /norris, and /chucknorris.

## Modifiers for slash commands*:

### Example Usage: "/cn g" will send a Chuck Norris fact to your guild, provided you are in one.
